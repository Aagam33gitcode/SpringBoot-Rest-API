# SpringBoot-Rest-API
This repository contains a Spring Boot project that demonstrates a complete implementation of a RESTful API with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The project also features robust Spring Exception Handling to gracefully manage runtime errors and provide meaningful responses to API consumers.
